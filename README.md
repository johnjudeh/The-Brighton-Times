# The Brighton Times

## Description

The Brighton Times is an exercise from Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist
Nanodegree program. I have reworked the website to make it responsive across any
device size using a Mostly Fluid pattern and adding responsive images
using the picture html element.

Check out the design here: https://johnjudeh.github.io/The-Brighton-Times/
